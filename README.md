# Atom package: reverse-scroll-wheel

Basic reversing scroll wheel functionality for editors and tree view.

By default it is turned on. It can be turned on/off by: `Packages -> Reverse Scroll Wheel -> Toggle` or by toggling `Activate` option in settings.

The purpose of this package is to fix broken functionality of mouse scroll wheel on some Linux systems (probably due to broken chrome engine, see Issue 582547).
Of course you may want to use it just because you can.

**Note**: It works for editors and tree view only! Other kind of panels are not handled.
