# Atom package: reverse-scroll-wheel

Basic reversing scroll wheel functionality for editors.

By default it is turned off. It can be turned on/off by: `Packages -> Reverse Scroll Wheel -> Toggle`.

The purpose of this package is to fix broken functionality of mouse scroll wheel on some Linux systems (probably due to broken chrome engine, see Issue 582547).
Of course you may want to use it just because you can.

**Note**: Unfortunately it works only for editors, not for tree-view, settings etc.
